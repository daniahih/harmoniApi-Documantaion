          API documentation is a set of written resources and guides that
          provide comprehensive information about an API (Application
          Programming Interface). It serves as a reference for developers,
          explaining how to interact with the API, what endpoints are available,
          and how to structure API requests and interpret responses. The
          documentation typically includes details about authentication,
          request/response formats, error handling, rate limiting, and any
          specific conventions or requirements. It acts as a user manual,
          helping developers understand the API's capabilities, integration
          options, and best practices. API documentation plays a crucial role in
          facilitating the adoption and usage of an API by providing clear
          instructions and examples, enabling developers to effectively utilize
          the API's functionality within their own applications or services.
